# Ideas, Random Thoughts, Suggestions:

- Having options to both play the computer, as well as to receive gameplay suggestions from the computer.
    - Could use minimax algorithm to determine gameplay strategies
- Might try to find existing Java code that performs regular card games and make edits to that.
- Could use R, which has existing card game packages as well as an Rjava package, to perform some statistical analyis.
- Features for different methods of gameplay (which are regionally unique), for example certain card combinations award more points than others.  (This link [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pim3HKiWRs&t=1588s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pim3HKiWRs&t=1588s) has been helpful for some personal preliminary research.)
- Options to connect with other players virtually?

    - rather than connecting through the internet, perhaps you might split the screen or make a variety of possible inputs, similar to playing wii or super smash bros, so that multiple people can play on the same device at the same time

- Try and create different difficulties when playing against the computer
- Here is a card game example in Java: [Game](http://www.techdive.in/java/card-game-using-java#:~:text=By%20arunraj.%20Here%20is%20a%20simple%20game%20played,number%20wins%20the%20round%20and%20gets%20a%20point.)
